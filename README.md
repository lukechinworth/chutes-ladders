# Chutes and ladders

Been playing this lately, and got curious about the average turns it takes to finish a game. Well, simulating 100,000 games has these results:

* Min 6
* Max ~300
* Ave ~36

Min never got below 6, so I guess that's the "perfect" game. This is using the chutes and laddders placements from a recent $5 version from walmart. The original board appears to have almost identical placements.
